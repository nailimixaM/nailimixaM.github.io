I'm a Member of Technical Staff at Microsoft AI in London where I work on LLM pretraining for [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com). 

Previously, I was a Researcher at Microsoft Research where I worked on LLM [pruning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15024) and [quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00456). Before that I completed my BA, MEng & PhD in Engineering at Cambridge University. You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X8UdvWUAAAAJ&hl=en).
