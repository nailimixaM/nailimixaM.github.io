## Hi, I'm Max

I'm a Member of Technical Staff at Microsoft AI in London where I work on LLM pretraining. 

Previously, I was a Postdoc Researcher at Microsoft Research and before that I completed my BA, MEng & PhD in Engineering at Cambridge University. You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X8UdvWUAAAAJ&hl=en).
